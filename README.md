# piece-wise-linearization-method
Piecewise linearization is a mathematical technique used to approximate a nonlinear function with a piecewise linear function. 
This method is commonly used in numerical analysis and optimization to simplify complex nonlinear functions and make them amenable to linear techniques.

The basic idea behind piecewise linearization is to divide the nonlinear function into smaller segments or intervals and approximate each segment with a linear function. 
These linear functions are then combined to form a piecewise linear approximation of the original nonlinear function.
